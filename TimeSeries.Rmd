This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(fpp3)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

tidy data frames are "tibbles"
"tsibbles" extends "tibbles" with time index
Tsibbles
```{r}
y <- tsibble(
  Year = 2015:2019,
  Observation = c(123,39,78,52,110),
  index = Year
)
y

## Convert tibble to tsibble
z <- tibble(
  Month = c("2019 Jan","2019 Feb"),
  Observation = c(123,32)
)
z

z %>% 
  mutate(Month = yearmonth(Month)) %>%
  as_tsibble(index = Month)

```
Frequency Function
Annual	start:end
Quarterly	yearquarter()
Monthly	yearmonth()
Weekly	yearweek()
Daily	as_date(), ymd()
Sub-daily	as_datetime(), ymd_hms()

#> # A tsibble: 312 x 4 [4Y]
#> # Key:       Length, Sex [14]
Tsibble will output [4Y] to mean "interval" of index
[14] means 14 separate time series identified by "length x Sex" 
```{r}
olympic_running
olympic_running %>% distinct(Sex) #2 Sex
olympic_running %>% distinct(Length) #7 Lengths
#2 Sex x 7 Length = 14 Keys
```

dplyr functions such as mutate(), filter(), select() and summarise() to work with tsibble objects
```{r}
PBS

PBS %>% 
  filter(ATC2 == "A10") %>%
  select(Month,Concession,Type,Cost) %>%
  summarise(TotalC = sum(Cost)) %>%
  mutate(Cost = TotalC/1e6) -> savedResult

```

```{r}
prison <- readr::read_csv("https://OTexts.com/fpp3/extrafiles/prison_population.csv")

prison
prison <- prison %>%
  mutate(Quarter = yearquarter(Date))  %>%
  select(-Date) %>%
  as_tsibble(key = c(State,Gender,Legal,Indigenous), index = Quarter)
prison
```
